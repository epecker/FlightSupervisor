| 1      | Landing performed at LP after single LP found during LZE scan.                                                   | Helicopter on the ground after completing a landing and issuing the mission complete signal. |
| 2      | Landing performed at LP after multiple LPs found during LZE scan.                                                | Helicopter on the ground after completing a landing and issuing the mission complete signal. |
| 3      | Landing performed at LP after single LP found before PLP achieved.                                               | Helicopter on the ground after completing a landing and issuing the mission complete signal. |
| 4      | Landing performed at LP after multiple LPs found before PLP achieved.                                            | Helicopter on the ground after completing a landing and issuing the mission complete signal. |
| 5      | Landing performed at LP after multiple LPs found during LZE scan but some ignored due to LP accept timer expiry. | Helicopter on the ground after completing a landing and issuing the mission complete signal. |
| 6      | Landing performed at LP after multiple LPs found during LZE scan but some ignored due to landing attempt.        | Helicopter on the ground after completing a landing and issuing the mission complete signal. |
| 7      | Control handed to pilot after no LPs found during LZE scan.                                                      | Helicopter hovering at PLP after BOSS and GCS updates sent.                                  |
| 8      | Control handed to pilot after LP reposition timer expired.                                                       | Helicopter hovering at PLP after BOSS and GCS updates sent.                                  |
| 9      | Landing performed after new mission loaded during on route phase.                                                | Helicopter on the ground after completing a landing and issuing the mission complete signal. |
| 10     | Landing performed after new mission loaded after landing achieved previously.                                    | Helicopter on the ground after completing a landing and issuing the mission complete signal. |
| 11     | Landing performed after new mission loaded after pilot handover during LZE scan.                                 | Helicopter on the ground after completing a landing and issuing the mission complete signal. |
| 12     | Landing performed after new mission loaded after pilot handover during LP reposition.                            | Helicopter on the ground after completing a landing and issuing the mission complete signal. |
