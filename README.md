## About The Project

We will be creating a simulation of a Supervisory Controller modelled using
DEVS that can be deployed onto the Bell-412 as part of the closed-loop autonomy systems used by
CVLAD.

## Built With

* Boost<span>.</span>org
* CMake
* SimulationEverywhere/Cadmium
* SimulationEverywhere/NDTime

## Prerequisites

Note: CMake version 3.22 support up to Boost version 1.75. Do not install a version of boost newer than 1.75.

### GNU/Linux - Ubuntu

Using a terminal perform the following.

* Update the Ubuntu repositories

	```
	apt update
	```

* Upgrade the Ubuntu System

	```
	apt upgrade
	```

* Install the ubuntu development tools

	```
	apt install build-essential
	```

* Install Boost version 1.74

	```
	apt install libboost1.74-all-dev
	```

* Install CMake via snap

	```
	snap install cmake â€“classic
	```

* Install Git

	```
	apt install git
	```

### MacOS - XCode with Homebrew

Using a terminal perform the following.

* Install cmake
	```
	brew install cmake
	```

* Find a version of boost up to and including version 1.75
	```
	brew search boost
	```

* Install a suitable version of boost. Replace 1.75 with a version listed above that is version 1.75 or lower.
	```
	brew search boost@1.75
	```

* XCode bundles the git binary.
	* If Git is not in the path you can install Git anyways using
		```
		brew install git
		```

### Windows 10 - Visual Studio Community

Managing Visual Studio Community

* Install "Desktop development with C++" with the default options listed under workloads.

Installing Boost

* Navigate to https://www.boost.org/users/download/
* Navigate down to "Other Downloads"
* Click on "Prebuilt windows binaries"
* Navigate down to "1.75.0"
* Click on "1.75.0"
* Download a version of the boost binary.
	* msvc = Microsoft Visual C++
	* 14.2 = Version of the msvc compiler
		* 14.3 corresponds to Visual Community 2022.
		* 14.2 corresponds to Visual Community 2019.
		* 14.1 corresponds to Visual Community 2017.
		* Must select a version equal to or less than your current version of visual studio. For example, Visual Community 2022 uses msvc 14.3, but is compatable with the boost binaries for msvc 14.2 and msvc 14.1.
	* 32 = 32 bit binary
	* 64 = 64 bit binary
	* We are currently using "boost_1_75_0-msvc-14.2-64.exe"
* Install the boost library using the executable you downloaded above. The path **must** be set to the default location.

## Build Guide

* Navigate your repository folder

	```
	cd /path/to/repositories
	```

* Clone the FlightSupervisor repository using one of the following methods
	* https: `https://github.com/SimulationEverywhere-Models/FlightSupervisor.git`

		```
		git clone https://github.com/SimulationEverywhere-Models/FlightSupervisor.git
		```

	* ssh: `git@github.com:SimulationEverywhere-Models/FlightSupervisor.git`

		```
		git clone git@github.com:SimulationEverywhere-Models/FlightSupervisor.git
		```

* Continue with the platform specific instructions below

### GNU/Linux - Ubuntu

Using the terminal perform the following.

* Create a build directory

	```
	mkdir ./FlightSupervisor/build
	```

* Navigate to the build directory

	```
	cd ./FlightSupervisor/build
	```

* Generate the build files

	```
	cmake ..
	```

* Build the executables

	```
	make
	```

* You can now run the project executables
* If you make any changes to the **CMakeLists.txt** file you will need to run `cmake ..` in the build folder to generate updated make files.

### MacOS - XCode with Homebrew

Using the terminal perform the following.

* Create a build directory

	```
	mkdir ./FlightSupervisor/build
	```

* Navigate to the build directory

	```
	cd ./FlightSupervisor/build
	```

* Generate the build files

	```
	cmake -G Xcode ..
	```

	* If the above cmake command did not work you can try resetting your XCode path then running cmake again.

		```
		xcode-select --reset
		cmake -G Xcode ..
		```

* Open XCode using the project solution that cmake created in the build folder
* You can now build and run the project using XCode's internal tools
* If you make any changes to the **CMakeLists.txt** file you will need to run `cmake -G Xcode` in the build folder to generate a updated project solution.

### Windows 10 - Visual Studio Community

* Open Visual Studio Community
* Click "Open a local folder"
* Open the repository
* Generate the build files
	* Visual Studio Community does this automatically
	* If it doesn't
		```
		Project > Configure Cache
		```
* Build the project
	```
	build > build all
	```
* Select a startup item to run the project
* Visual Studio Community will regenerate the cmake cache on **CMakeList.txt** changes.
